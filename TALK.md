# Tips for attending/giving a presentation

If you are the presenter:

1. Motivation of the paper? Why is it important? 
2. Using one slide to introduce necessary background so that people can follow the rest of the materials.
3. What are the challenges?
4. What is the solution? Explain the solution in an idiot-proof way. 
5. How well is the proposed approach? Highlight the results.
6. Fewer texts, more figures and animations.
7. Do NOT directly copy content from the paper, rephrase with your own words.

If you are the audience:

1. Make sure you read the paper before the talk!
2. Listen the talk carefully and respect your classmates.
3. Come up with questions during the talk.
