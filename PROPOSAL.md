1. Define the problem. What is it? Why is it important? 
2. Give a motivating running example to illustrate the problem.
3. What are the challenges in your project? 
4. What is the tentative solution for this problem?
5. How do you evaluate the successfulness of your approach? What are the data set or benchmarks? Are you comparing other tools?
